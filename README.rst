==========================
Chrome OAuth Bearer Plugin
==========================

Chrome browser plugin to inject OAuth 2 bearer tokens into outgoing HTTP requests (``Authorization`` header).

This plugin should allow browsing simple RESTful OAuth 2 resource servers directly from Chrome.
RESTful resource servers (microservices) should be kept simple and thus do not implement the full OAuth2 authorization code flow.

See also the `HTTPie Zign plugin`_ which does something similar for HTTP requests on the command line.
